## The History of Is-a.space

is-a.space started as is-a.vps
it was small back than
and holy shit it was growing fast. we used to provide 8GB and 4 cores for free. and it used to be good,
like 600 members to 1K, however it didnt last long, we had countless issues with staff.

1 of them is
- Lylanodes (Shitty hosting made by the clowns) (they were stealing our members and staff)

Because of lylanodes, is-a.space got nuked and we were disapointed. i gave up afterwards and i hate hosting now, I lost all my modviation to hosting and have now finally after 3 years accepted my faith in humanity.
We used to use proxmox untill we moved to jexactyl and than pterodactyl and than pterodactyl with the steller theme.

PS Our nodes over the history
- 32GB RAM 192 core Intel i5 Node (still exists today)
- 192GB RAM 48 core Intel Xeon Node (Germen node) (Dead) (we got 3 of them, but dead afterwards) (this was the greatest age of is-a.vps, The golden age in fact)
- 75GB RAM 4 core Intel Xeon Node (Spain node) (Dead) (Lost age. started losing members)
